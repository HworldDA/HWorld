# HWorld
This project is a simple map application
which shows HelloWorld locations on a dynamic map,
and then a list of the locations beneath it.
When the location is clicked a detail screen appears,
the screen has two action buttons to call the office and 
to get directions to the office. Note when directions button
pressed it will give you the distance in miles to the office in
the description area which holds the address of the location.
